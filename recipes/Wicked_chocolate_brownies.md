# Wicked chocolate brownies 

This dish will be fast to make and helps you to impress your colleagues in the coffee break.

## Ingredients

+ 200 g butter (softened)
+ 1.5 cups of sugar
+ 1 cup cocoa
+ 3 eggs
+ 0.5 cup flour
+ 150 g roughly chopped white chocolate (or caramel/fudge pieces)

Decoration:

+ powdered sugar

## Tools

+ mixer

## Preparation

+ Beat sugar, butter & cocoa for 4-5 minutes using a mixer, until creamy. This bit is very messy, try beating sugar and butter or a little bit before adding cocoa so that the cocoa has something wet to stick to rather than going everywhere. You could also melt the butter before adding it to the mix.
+ Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition
+ Stir in flour and white chocolate (or caramel/fudge)
+ Transfer mixture into a glass or oven proof dish thas has an area of approximately 20 x 20 cm. Glass is better than a baking tin because it makes it easier to cut.
+ Bake at 150 degrees Celsius for about an hour or until surface of Brownie appears cracked. Centre should look almost uncooked - but still be cooked. Will be extremely gooey while still warm, wait til cooled til cut up.
